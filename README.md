This script will begin to clean an unorganized dataset of wearable fitness device data. The script was written by Kieran Lydon for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course project offered by Coursera. 

The user will need to confirm the url is correct and then set their own local directory so that the files will be saved in a location directly chosen by user.

The script will merge test and train data, select the appropriate columns for viewing, tidy the column names, and finally create an additional dataset of the averages.
